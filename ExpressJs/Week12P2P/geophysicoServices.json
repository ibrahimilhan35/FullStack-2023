    "name": "Seismic Reflection",
    "content": "Seismic reflection is a geophysical technique for imaging the stratigraphic boundaries and geologic structure (such as faults, stratigraphic layering and folding) at depths between tens of meters and kilometers. Seismic energy is generated on the earth's surface, travels through sediment and rock, bounces back off of boundaries with differing rock densities, and is detected by geophones at specific separations from the source. The design of a survey includes many settings like geophone spacing and locations, energy source type and power and frequency, 'shot' locations and choice of recording seismograph. The data is processed using a variety of methods to create a two-dimensional cross section of the subsurface.",
    "applications": "Applications include site assessments for civil engineering, geologic mapping, and geothermal, mineral, and oil and gas explorations.",

    "name": "Sub-bottom Profiler",
    "content": "Acoustic sub-bottom profiling (SBP) systems are used to determine physical properties of the sea floor and to image and characterize geological information from a few meters to tens of meters below the sea floor. Sub-bottom profilers typically consist of a single channel source that emits sound pulses into the shallow sediments of the subsea floor. The source frequency determines the image resolution and penetration depth, and scattering further limits them in coarse sediment or highly compacted sands. Due to changes in acoustic impedance (hardness), sound pulses reflect off the sea floor and underlying buried sediment layers. The different times taken for this signal to be returned and recorded by the SBP indicate how deep the layers are below the sea floor.",

    "name": "Seismic Refraction",
    "content": "Seismic refraction is a geophysical technique for identifying the seismic compression-wave (P-wave) velocity structure of the subsurface. Seismic P-waves are created on the ground, travel through the soil and rock, and are picked up by geophones at specific distances from the source. P-waves, the fastest component of the seismic wave, are the first energy to arrive at each geophone (either direct or refracted). In order to determine the subsurface seismic P-wave velocities, the travel times of the first arriving energy are first recorded by a seismograph. The data are utilized to create a 2D P-wave velocity cross-section using a tomographic inversion.",

    "content": "Multi-channel Analysis of Surface Waves (MASW) is a seismic method that uses the dispersive characteristics of surface waves to determine the variation of shear-wave (S-wave) velocity with depth. Shear-wave velocity depends on the elastic properties of the rock and soil and is inversely proportional to the materials' stiffness and hardness. This technique is particularly helpful for pinpointing velocity inversions that other seismic techniques struggle with, such as soft soil zones beneath stiff or cemented soil or weathered bedrock beneath more competent bedrock.",
    "applications": "Applications include stratigraphic mapping, depth -to-bedrock surveys, identifying anomalous soft/weak zones in soil and weathered rock for seismic hazard determination, correlating SPT and other borehole data, and mapping karst and other geologic hazards.",

    "content": "Ground penetrating radar (GPR) uses high-frequency pulsed electromagnetic waves to map the subsurface. With GPR, transmitting and receiving antennas are dragged along the surface. The transmitting antenna sends short bursts of high-frequency radio waves into the earth. The wave spreads out and propagates downward. When a buried object or a boundary with different electrical characteristics is encountered, the receiving antenna records variations in the reflected return signal.",

    "name": "Electrical Resistivity",
    "content": "Electrical resistivity imaging is used to obtain a two-dimensional (2D) cross-section of electrical resistivity, which depends on the kind of soil and rock, its porosity, its permeability, and the makeup of the fluids that fill the pore spaces. If there is a strong enough resistivity contrast, stratigraphic layers and anomalous zones can be located using the data. For instance, compared to sand and gravel layers, clay layers often have a substantially lower electrical resistance. A number of electrodes are contacted with the soil or rock to determine electrical resistance. Between one set of electrodes, a current is introduced while the voltage across the other set of electrodes is gauged. A 2D resistivity model can be created from a dense dataset produced by serious of measurements using various arrangements of electrode spacings.",
